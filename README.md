# WIP
This project is under active development, and as such is in a pre-alpha state. This tool should not be used in production until this disclaimer is removed.

# Coverage
This analyzer will provide a bytecode level code coverage analysis of a mocha test suite. It will use a modified TestRPC client to recieve information about what bytecode has been used during the execution of the test suite.
